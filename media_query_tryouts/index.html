          <strong> Jasmine </strong> is the deuteragonist of Aladdin, its two
          sequels, and the television series. Linda Larkin provides Jasmine's
          voice in all animated iterations of Aladdin, Lea Salonga provides the
          singing voice for Jasmine in the original Aladdin, Liz Callaway
          provides the singing voice for Jasmine in the sequels. Jasmine is the
          daughter (and only child) of the Sultan of Agrabah, the traditional
          title styled "Shahzadi Sultana" (Princess).

          When she marries Aladdin, a commoner (the son of the self-styled "King
          of Thieves" notwithstanding), he gains the title, Prince Consort. Upon
          the death or abdication of her father in favor of Aladdin (as was
          stated to be the Sultan's wish), Aladdin would become the Sultan of
          Agrabah and Jasmine would acquire the title of Sultana. She is the
          first princess to not be the titular character in her film and is the
          first non-white and the first Middle Eastern/southwest Asian princess.
